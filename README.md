### Django Capstone Project

Hello! This repo is my self-study project from Codecademy Build Web Apps with Django Course.
I've been asked to build an application for a restaurant to keep track how much food it has throughout the day.

**Here is a list of requirements to the App**

Restaurant's personal starts the day with:
- An inventory of different Ingredients, their available quantity, and their prices per unit;
- A list of the restaurantâ€™s MenuItems, and the price set for each entry;
- A list of the ingredients that each menu item requires (RecipeRequirements);
- A log of all Purchases made at the restaurant.

Knowing this information they should be able to:
- Enter in new recipes along with their recipe requirements, and how much that menu item costs;
- Add to the inventory a name of an ingredient, its price per unit, and how much of that item is available;
- Enter in a customer purchase of a menu item. When a customer purchases an item off the menu,
the inventory should be modified to accommodate what happened, as well as recording the time that the purchase was made.

I implemented these features so that the app performs them for each new day separately.
